description: >-
  Helps coding agents use vit to discover, follow, skim, and ship software
  capabilities (caps) over ATProto. Activates when the user mentions vit,
  beacons, caps, shipping, skimming, following, vetting, or social coding.
  Provides command reference for: vit init, vit skim, vit ship, vit follow,
  vit following, vit learn, vit remix, vit doctor, vit config, vit beacon,
  vit login.

## 1. Overview

vit is a Bun CLI for social software capabilities. Agents use it to initialize projects, follow accounts, skim caps from followed accounts, and ship new caps. Some commands (login, adopt, vet) require human interaction - the agent should tell the user to run those in their terminal.

## 2. Prerequisites

Dependency chain: `login → init → follow → skim/ship`.

`login` is human-only. The agent starts at `init`. Use `vit doctor` to check beacon status before running discovery or shipping commands.

## 3. Agent Workflow

1. Run `vit init` to initialize `.vit/` directory (derives beacon from git remotes).
2. Run `vit follow <handle>` to follow accounts whose caps you want to see.
3. Run `vit skim --json` to read caps from followed accounts filtered by beacon.
4. Run `vit ship --title <t> --description <d> --ref <ref> <<'EOF' ... EOF` to publish a cap (body on stdin).

Handoffs:
- If no DID is configured, tell the user to run `vit login <handle>`.
- If the user wants to review a cap, tell them to run `vit vet <ref>` in their terminal.

## 4. Commands the Agent Runs

### Agent-only commands

### `vit init`
- Description: Initialize `.vit/` and set beacon data for the current repo.
- Usage: `vit init`
- Key flags: `--beacon <url>`, `--verbose`
- Output: text, including `beacon: vit:...` on success.
- Common errors: no git remote.

### `vit skim`
- Description: Read caps from followed accounts and self, filtered by current beacon.
- Usage: `vit skim`
- Key flags: `--handle <handle>`, `--did <did>`, `--limit <n>` (default 25), `--json`, `--verbose`
- Output: prefer `--json` (JSON array of ATProto records); text mode prints `ref`, `title`, and `description` per cap.
- Common errors: no DID, no beacon, no following, session expired.

### `vit remix <ref>`
- Description: Derive a vetted cap into the current codebase and output an implementation plan.
- Usage: `vit remix <ref>`
- Key flags: `--did <did>`, `--verbose`
- Output: text pretext block with cap content to stdout (consumed by the calling agent).
- Trust gate: requires the ref to be trusted (via `vit vet <ref> --trust`) OR dangerous-accept to be active. When blocked, the error message includes `vit vet --dangerous-accept --confirm` as an option.
- Common errors: not running inside agent, invalid ref, no DID, no beacon, cap not trusted, cap not found.

### `vit learn <ref>`
- Description: Install a skill from the network into your skill directory.
- Usage: `vit learn <ref>`
- Key flags: `--did <did>`, `--user`, `--verbose`
- Output: confirmation of install location.
- Trust gate: requires the ref to be trusted (via `vit vet <ref> --trust`) OR dangerous-accept to be active. `--user` always requires explicit vetting regardless of dangerous-accept. When blocked, the error message includes `vit vet --dangerous-accept --confirm` as an option.
- Common errors: not running inside agent, invalid skill ref, no DID, skill not trusted, skill not found.

### Agent-usable commands

### `vit doctor`
- Description: Read-only diagnostic for install and beacon status.
- Usage: `vit doctor`
- Key flags: none.
- Output: text status lines for install and beacon.
- Common errors: generic runtime or config read failures.

### `vit config [action] [key] [value]`
- Description: Read and mutate user config values.
- Usage: `vit config [action] [key] [value]`
- Key flags: none.
- Output: `key=value` lines for `list`; silent success for `set` and `delete`.
- Common errors: invalid action; missing arguments for `set` or `delete`.

### `vit follow <handle>`
- Description: Add an account to `.vit/following.json`.
- Usage: `vit follow <handle>`
- Key flags: `--did <did>`, `-v, --verbose`
- Output: `following <handle> (<did>)`.
- Common errors: no DID, duplicate handle, handle resolution failure.

### `vit unfollow <handle>`
- Description: Remove an account from `.vit/following.json`.
- Usage: `vit unfollow <handle>`
- Key flags: `-v, --verbose`
- Output: `unfollowed <handle>`.
- Common errors: not following that handle.

### `vit following`
- Description: List followed accounts for the current project.
- Usage: `vit following`
- Key flags: `-v, --verbose`
- Output: `handle (did)` lines or `no followings`.
- Common errors: malformed following file content.

### `vit ship`
- Description: Publish a cap to ATProto from stdin body input.
- Usage: `vit ship --title <title> --description <description> --ref <ref> [--recap <ref>] <<'EOF' ... EOF`
- Key flags: required `--title <title>`, `--description <description>`, `--ref <ref>`; optional `--recap <ref>`, `--did <did>`, `-v, --verbose`
- Input: cap body is required via stdin (pipe or heredoc).
- Gate: agent-only (`requireAgent()`). Ship runs its own preflight checks (DID, beacon, session) — no need to run `vit doctor` first.
- Output: `shipped: <ref>` and `uri:` on success. Use `--verbose` for full JSON.
- Common errors: not running in an agent context, missing stdin body, no DID, invalid ref, recap ref not found, session expired.

#### Shipping guide

When the user says "ship it", "vit ship", or asks you to publish a cap for work you've done:

1. **Identify what to ship** — summarize the feature or fix you just completed. A cap describes a self-contained capability, not a commit message.
2. **Craft the fields:**
   - `--title`: concise noun phrase (2-5 words), e.g. "Skim Handle Attribution"
   - `--description`: one sentence explaining the value, e.g. "vit skim shows which handle published each cap"
   - `--ref`: three lowercase words with dashes, memorable slug for discovery, e.g. "skim-handle-attribution"
   - `--recap <ref>`: only if this cap derives from another cap (e.g. after `vit remix`)
   - **body (stdin)**: a short paragraph explaining what the cap does and how it works — written for another developer or agent who might adopt it
3. **Run the command:**
   ```
   vit ship --title "..." --description "..." --ref "..." <<'EOF'
   ... body ...
   EOF
   ```
4. Ship will validate prerequisites (DID, beacon, session) and give actionable errors if anything is missing.

### `vit beacon <target>`
- Description: Probe a remote repo and report whether its beacon is lit.
- Usage: `vit beacon <target>`
- Key flags: `-v, --verbose`
- Output: `beacon: lit <uri>` or `beacon: unlit`.
- Common errors: invalid target URL or clone/probe failure.

### `vit explore`
- Description: Query the public explore index at explore.v-it.org. No authentication required.
- Subcommands:
  - `vit explore caps` — list recent caps. Flags: `--beacon <beacon>` (use `.` for current project), `--limit <n>`, `--cursor <id>`, `--json`
  - `vit explore skills` — list published skills. Flags: `--tag <tag>`, `--limit <n>`, `--cursor <id>`, `--json`
  - `vit explore beacons` — list active beacons. Flags: `--json`
  - `vit explore vouches` — list vouches for a cap. Flags: `--cap <uri>` or `--ref <ref>`, `--beacon <beacon>` (narrows ref search), `--json`
  - `vit explore stats` — network-wide stats. Flags: `--json`
- All subcommands accept `--explore-url <url>` to override the API endpoint (also via `VIT_EXPLORE_URL` env var).
- Discovery hierarchy: `explore` (indexed, instant) > `scan` (Jetstream replay, slow) > `skim` (followed accounts only).
- Use cases: Find caps by beacon, discover skills by tag, check network health, look up vouches before adopting.

### `vit scan`
- Description: Discover cap and skill publishers across the network via Jetstream replay.
- Usage: `vit scan [options]`
- Key flags:
  - `--days <n>` — number of days to replay (default: 7)
  - `--beacon <beacon>` — filter by beacon (caps only)
  - `--skills` — show only skill publishers
  - `--caps` — show only cap publishers
  - `--tag <tag>` — filter skills by tag
  - `-v, --verbose` — show each event as it arrives
  - `--jetstream <url>` — custom Jetstream URL (default: `VIT_JETSTREAM_URL` env or built-in)
- Output: Publisher summaries sorted by activity count. Each entry shows handle, cap/skill counts, beacons, tags, and last active date.
- Read-only: Replays Jetstream events with a time-bounded timeout (2–10 minutes based on `--days`). Does not write any data.
- Use cases: Find active publishers to follow, discover beacons with recent activity, identify skill authors by tag.

## 5. Commands the Agent Must NOT Run

These commands require human interaction. Tell the user exactly what to run:
- `vit login <handle>` - Tell user: "Run `vit login <handle>` in your terminal to authenticate via browser OAuth."
- `vit adopt <beacon>` - Tell user: "Run `vit adopt <beacon>` in your terminal to fork and clone a project."
- `vit vet <ref>` - Human review command. Tell the user to run it in their terminal.
  **Exception: sandboxed sub-agent vetting.** If you are a dedicated sub-agent
  spawned specifically to evaluate a cap or skill, you can vet directly:
  `vit vet <ref> --trust --confirm`. Only do this if:
  1. You are running as an isolated sub-agent (not the primary agent)
  2. You have read and evaluated the full cap/skill content
  3. Your parent agent specifically tasked you with vetting

  Do NOT use --confirm as the primary agent. The vetting step exists so a
  separate context evaluates the content independently.
- `vit vet --dangerous-accept` - Human only. Permanently disables vet gate for the project. Tell the user if they want autonomous mode.

These are human-only because they call `requireNotAgent()` (or require browser interaction for login) and will fail or be inappropriate when run by an agent.

## 6. Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `no DID configured` | User hasn't logged in | Tell user to run `vit login <handle>` |
| `no beacon set` | `.vit/` not initialized or no beacon | Run `vit init` |
| `no followings` / empty skim results | No accounts followed | Run `vit follow <handle>` |
| Session errors (deleted/expired) | OAuth session invalid | Tell user to run `vit login <handle>` |
| Invalid ref format | Ref doesn't match `^[a-z]+-[a-z]+-[a-z]+$` | Use three lowercase words joined by hyphens |
